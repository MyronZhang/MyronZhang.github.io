<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there! I am a PhD student studying at the School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia. I am currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant and UBC Sustainability Scholar. My research interest includes building energy efficiency, energy retrofits, occupant-centric building management, and grid-interactive buildings. I have published 7 papers at top Civil Engineering journals and conferences. I enjoy playing basketball and watching NBA games and Athletics during my leisure time. I am a big fan of the best basketball player in the world, Black Mamba-Kobe Bryant.
